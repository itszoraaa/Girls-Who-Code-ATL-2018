    <h2>All about me!</h2>
    <p>As a recent college graduate, I remember how difficult it was to prepare for the ACT, but after weeks of studying, I was able to get a perfect score! That is why I decided to help the next generation of scholars. I am available to help tutor from 4:00 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. every weekday, and from 11:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. on Saturdays and Sundays. I charge only $30 per hour, and I highly recommend buying a review book to further help you prepare for the test.</p>
